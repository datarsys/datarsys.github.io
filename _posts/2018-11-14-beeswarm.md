title: Beeswarm – an HTML Tool using Python
image: /img/portfolio/portfolio-swarmplot.png
oneliner: Have you ever wanted a swarmplot, violinplot, etc. in Alteryx? (Or prep the data for Tableau?)
type: Alteryx

Accepting the challenge to build an [HTML tool][html-tool] in Alteryx (in my case, with the Python engine), I settled for something I’ve been missing from the reporting tools (even with the added Plotly features):

A simple way to create a **swarmplot**. I was hoping to be using the
[PyBeeswarm](https://github.com/mgymrek/pybeeswarm) module, that offered
multiple ways of jittering the data, but it seems to not be updated
anymore so, instead, created a wrapper for
[seaborn.swarmplot,](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.swarmplot.html) which,
additionally, allows for an overlay with violin plots or box plots.

The packaged tool
is [here ](https://dsmdaviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/SwarmPlot12.yxi)(.yxi
installer) and a sample
workflow [here.](https://dsmdaviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BeeSwarmSampleWF.yxzp)  [\

Bringing the tool to the canvas, connecting it to the data stream and
running the workflow once (so that the tool becomes aware of the fields
available upstream) will bring the configuration window with the options
to configure.

![configuration window - select measures, categorical to split, color,
overlays,
etc.](https://dsmdaviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/config12.png#midsizeR)

Configuration of the BeeSwarm Tool

-   Required items:
    1.  At least one numeric measure
-   Optional:
    1.  Other measures.
    2.  One categorical variable to split the dots.
    3.  A column to specify the color.
    4.  Settings for the graph (Despine or not – and then trim it or
        not, Show/Hide Legends).
    5.  Select overlay: None, Boxplot, Violinplot.

### Swarmplot without color source

When a column with the color information is not provided, colors are
assigned randomly.

The current version doesn’t accept a color column when no key is added
(it will color the different measures randomly).  [Click here to open the video if it's not playing embedded](https://dsmdaviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/random_colors.webm)
