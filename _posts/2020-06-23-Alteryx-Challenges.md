title: Alteryx Challenges | Datarsys
subtitle: Gamified learning of Alteryx
---
The *Weekly Challenges* are a powerful tool for learning Alteryx.Each week a use case is posted to test the community's Alteryx skills. Sharing the answers and approaches ensures multiple approaches can be explored and iterated by the challengers. Add some gamification and nice badges and you get a group of committed solvers in a continuous journey of learning.
These are some of the badges collected:

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
